I changed the entire color theme that was included with the orginal 
template.
See css/myStyles.css lines 2,5,8,11,14,17,24,29,35,38.

I added a:hover to the navbar-brand that says Kevin Woolgar
See css/myStyles.css line 8.

I added tooltips to all the anchor tag hyperlinks 
on the navigation bar and the footer.

I had added a working carousel to my Skills division (under my table), but 
I removed it because it was giving my multiple Validator errors, which 
the rubric says we cannot have. I took screenshot of the carousel and the 
validator errors. They are both in the screenshots folder. Also, I left the
original carousel images in the img folder.
